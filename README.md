# DO2_Calculator
Simple calculator for checking DO2 for use in open-heart surgery by perfusionists

Perfusionists run the heart-lung machine during open-heart surgery. They monitor a 
large amount of data to determine what changes must be made to ensure no damage occurs
to a patients heart, lungs, or other organs. DO2 is kind of like a score, that indicates
how well they are managing the fluids (blood, meds, etc) that are flowing through the
patients circulatory system. This application allows them to plug in a few values and
then it calculates a score for them.
